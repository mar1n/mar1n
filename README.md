Collaborative and hard working Software Engineer looking for JavaScript/React/Node position in a strong tech culture environment. I started my tech journey in 2010 freelancing locally in Poland and remotely with a New York media company doing Wordpress/Joomla development. I moved to London in 2015 to fulfill my ambitions and worked temporarily as a chef for 5 years. In 2020 I decided to get formal training with a 2 month coding boot camp in ReactJS/MongoDB/Node. Since the boot camp I have completed dozens of open source projects on Github with increasing levels of complexity. I am now ready to do a permanent career change into tech. Since September 2020 I have been working with a private coding coach to refine and improve my existing coding skills. In 2021 I did an internship as a Full Stack  developer.
